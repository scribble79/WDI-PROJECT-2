# WDI-PROJECT-2
My second project

Speak! 

Speak! Is an app for spoken word artists, it's a platform for them to upload their own work and to view work from other artists around the world. The app has a landing page which is a looping video of people not speaking, with the words "Speak! Tell your story" next to them. This is designed to highlight that most people's opinions are not heard, and to encourage people to speak and tell ther stories and be heard. 

Once a user has registered or logged into the app they are taken to their homepage, here they can upload a photo of their choice and fill out a few details that will be shown on their homepage. They are then able to upload their video's via the upload page. Once they have uploaded a video it will be listed on the feed page with all the videos that all the other users have uploaded. Once a video has been posted onto the feed page, other users will then be able to leave comments about the video, and the user will be able to post comments on other users videos. Their video will also be posted to their own homepage which will house all of their uploads. Videos will only be editable by the uploader from their homepage. 

The app has been built in Ruby, hosted on Sinatra, and Pure has been used for the styling and the grid system. Three models were used to structure the app video, user, and comment.
